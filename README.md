# MyReads: A Book Tracking App with React

### introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice **React** and single page applications.
The application represents a sort of personal library with 3 shelves to categorize the books:
- Currently reading
- Want to read
- Read

Each shelf shows some books. The user can change shelf, remove a book from shelf or add a book to shelf.
To add a book to a certain shelf there is a plus button that once pressed reveals the search functionality of the app. There, the user can search for new books stored in the backend server(provided by Udacity).

## Technologies used
- React
- React Router
- Es6

## Getting started

* Clone or download this repo
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The app will be running at `localhost:3000`

## Live App

You can find the final app in the following link: [My Reads book tracking app](https://cahergil.github.io/myreads-book-tracking/)


## Backend Server

 Udacity has provided a backend server for us to develop against. The provided file `BooksAPI.js` contains the methods we will need to perform necessary operations on the backend

 Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
